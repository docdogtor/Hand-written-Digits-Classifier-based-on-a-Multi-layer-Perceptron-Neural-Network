# Hand-written-Digits-Classifier-based-on-a-Multi-layer-Perceptron-Neural-Network
Constructed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network (including forward and backpropagation) and used it to classify hand-written digit with no existing machine learning libraries. Sigmoid activation function was used at each layer; SoftMax was applied to generate probability distribution of multi-classes; entropy loss function was used to compute loss. MNIST dataset was used to train and test the neural network. Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and number of units at each hidden layer were tuned. The accuracy was higher than 0.92.
